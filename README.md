# `sourceforge-badges`

## Description

The `sourceforge-badges` displays various badges of the well-known project hosting platform, `SourceForge`.

Although the platform itself gives the code to integrate the badges, I still think that on the one hand there is code that is left over and on the other hand this should be done manually in the code.

This code simplifies the procedures, but also gives the user the ability to dynamically choose the display parameters of the badges on his website.

## What are `SourceForge` badges

SourceGorge's `badges` allow us to inform our "audience" of the acceptance of our projects, which are hosted on its servers.

Each badge has a different meaning and value.
